## Description:

- Blackjack! The player with the highest card sum wins. More then 21 results in a loss, and equal to 21 results in an automatic win (Blackjack). When the player hits the stay button, the dealer must draw until their cards total at least 17. From here the dealer will either lose by going over 21, win with a high score or win with a Blackjack.

- Built entirely with core JavaScript and no frameworks. It was assigned as an exercise for using conditional logic to update DOM elements. I'm happy to say that the instructor liked my CSS and code enough that he later used my project as a template to demonstrate for the class how to implement React.js and a playing cards API.

- Built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS
